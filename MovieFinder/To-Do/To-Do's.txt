To-Do's:

. Write a program that webscrapes nearby theaters from IMDB

. Write a program that uses information from other IMDB webscraping programs to check which theaters within a 30 mile radius have the movie that the user wants to see

. Create a UI mockup for the pages that will display the most convenient theaters from least to greatest in a table/list (Either scrollable or with multiple 5-10 theater pages)

. Create a UI mockup for the initial user interface (Where the user selects their desired paramters)

.Finilize both UI mockups
